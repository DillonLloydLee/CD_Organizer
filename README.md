####a program for users to catalog and organize their CDs, 8/6/15

#### By Samantha Maturen and Dillon Lee

## Description

_Remember CDs? Make a program for users to catalog and organize their CDs.

The home page (root path) should list out all of their CDs. If they haven't made any CD's yet, it should show a welcome message.

There should be a link on the home page which takes them to a "/new_cd" page. This page should be a form for the user to create a new CD by entering the CD title into a form.

Then, add a an "$artist" property to your CD class, so that users can choose what artist each CD is by. Keep it simple - assume each CD is just by a single artist.

After that, create another link on the home page to take the user to a "/searchbyartist" page. Here, users should be able to fill out a form with an artist name to search for in their collection. After submitting the form the user should be taken to a page listing out all the CDs they own by that artist.

Improve your search - if the user has created a CD object by "JS Bach" they should be able to search for it by typing in "bach", "Bach", and "Johann Sebastian Bach".

Say the user has a CD by "Bachman–Turner Overdrive" as well as one by "JS Bach". If the user searches by the name "bach", or "Bach", both the CDs by "JS Bach" and "Bachman–Turner Overdrive" should be displayed._
